# 3card

This repository is a terminal cards game I build as an MVP for a Mobile game I wanted to build later.

## Try it out

`npm i`
`npm run build` 
`npm start`

The the terminal will guide you through the game.
There isn't any rules explanation so good luck exploring (I'll add them here later maybe).

### Try it out faster

There are 3 binaries you could run instead. They are in the `dist` folder, one for linux, one for mac, one for windows (no binary to rule them all, I'm sorry)


## Build your own bot

You could potentially build your own bot by creating a new bot class. They are in the `/src/players` folder. Just extend the Bot class and have fun.


## Next steps

I'm currently creating a game server so you connect to other players online and play one against each other. But that's been done [here](https://github.com/ShakMR/my-trix-server) and still not finished.
